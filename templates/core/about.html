  <h2>{% trans "About" %}</h2>

  {% blocktrans %}
   <p> Since an early age, I’ve been driven by curiosity about the universe and by questions that still lack answers. My journey began in biology, but I soon discovered that my true calling is astrobiology — the quest to understand life beyond Earth. Every experience I’ve had, from research projects to hackathons and international courses, has strengthened my desire to contribute to this field. More than finding answers, I want to help expand the boundaries of what we know, and maybe inspire others to look up with the same sense of wonder and hope that moves me every day.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}

  {% blocktrans %}
    <p>I carry with me not only knowledge from various fields — such as biotechnology, citizen astronomy, and planetary science — but also a genuine desire to impact the future of science in a meaningful way. I remain committed to this journey, constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and ultimately leave a contribution that goes beyond myself.</p>

  <h3>{% trans "About Biospace" %}</h3>

  {% blocktrans %}
   <p>Biospace is a personal and scientific initiative born from that same curiosity — a space to explore the intersection between biology and astronomy, life and the cosmos. The project focuses on astrobiology and related disciplines, presenting content that bridges scientific research and public understanding.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}

  {% blocktrans %}
   <p>The goal of Biospace is to make complex ideas accessible, connecting people to the most intriguing questions in science: How did life begin? Could it exist elsewhere? What would it look like? These are the questions that guide the articles, reflections, and resources shared here.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}

  {% blocktrans %}
   <p>Special attention is given to extremophiles — lifeforms that thrive in extreme environments — and to Earth analogs, places on our planet that resemble other worlds. By studying them, we can imagine and model how life might survive in the harsh conditions of Mars, Europa, or Titan.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}

  {% blocktrans %}
    <p>Biospace also follows current scientific missions and discoveries, offering commentary and educational content about instruments, rovers, telescopes, and space agencies working to detect biosignatures and understand planetary environments. From the icy oceans of Enceladus to the atmosphere of distant exoplanets, every potential clue is a source of fascination.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  {% blocktrans %}
    <p>But Biospace is not just about the unknown. It’s also about the known — about valuing life on Earth, recognizing its rarity, and learning from it. Understanding our own planet is the first step toward understanding others. And as we look outward, we also deepen our appreciation for the fragile, extraordinary conditions that make life possible here.</p>
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  {% blocktrans %}
    <p>This platform is designed for anyone who shares a fascination with the universe: students, educators, science communicators, researchers, and the simply curious. It’s a place to learn, share, imagine, and question — together.</p>
